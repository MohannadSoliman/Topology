## Language Chosen
Java was chosen because:
1) Classes and interfaces are easy to understand in Java
2) Easy to manipulate and handle JSON files
3) I've developed a number of applications in Java

## Assumptions
1) API is static (No API Objected Created)
2) writeJSON method writes the JSON Object in a file called "savedTopologies.json" with the order of attributes within objects not maintained

## Notes
To review code documentation and analysis, download the folders "DOCS" and "Analysis" and open the file "index.html" in your browser
